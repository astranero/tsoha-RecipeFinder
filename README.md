# RecipeFinder

ReciperFinder is a recipe application that helps users to find the perfect recipe based on the items user has available in the kitchen. In short, a user can choose ingredients and the app will show all the recipes available with the chosen ingredients.

* Registering can be done either as an User or an Admin.

* Both Users and Admins may view available ingredient tags > choose ingredient tags > view available recipes with these chosen ingredients.

* Both may view a specific recipe, rate and comment it as well as add the recipe into favorites. Also, a shopping list can be created based on the ingredients that are needed to cook the recipe.

* Only Admins may add, modify and delete recipes and ingredient tags


I have created a product backlog and listed the functionalities in detail [here](https://github.com/riikkayoki/RecipeApp/projects/1).

## Hosting

The application is hosted on Heroku: https://tsoha-recipefinder.herokuapp.com/

* At the moment you may create an account and login to the application as well as view user details on profile page.
* The error messages do not show up at the moment on the application for example if creating password and the passwords do not match.
