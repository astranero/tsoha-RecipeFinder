# RecipeFinder

RecipeFinder is a recipe application that helps users to find the perfect recipe.

* Registering can be done either as an User or an Admin.

* Both may view their profile details and edit them.

* Both Users and Admins may view, rate and comment recipes as well as add the recipe into favorites.

* Only Admins may add, modify and delete recipes.

* Admins may add tags to recipes e.g 'Breakfast'

I have created a product backlog and listed the functionalities in detail [here](https://github.com/riikkayoki/RecipeApp/projects/1).
